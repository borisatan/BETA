2. Manual Transaction Logging
How it Works:
Users can manually enter transactions if they don’t have a receipt.
Transactions include: Amount, Date, Category, Payment Method, Notes.
Implementation Steps:
Create a Transaction Form

A simple form with input fields:
Amount (numeric input)
Date (date picker)
Category (dropdown selection)
Payment method (cash, credit, etc.)
Notes (text field)
Save Transaction Data

Store transactions in Firebase Firestore (or a local SQLite database for offline support).

3. Bank Syncing (Nordigen Integration)
How it Works:
Users connect their bank account to sync transactions automatically.
The app fetches recent transactions and categorizes them.
Implementation Steps:
Use Nordigen API

Register for Nordigen and get API credentials.
Use the Nordigen API to allow users to securely connect their bank.
Retrieve an access token to authenticate API requests.
Fetch Transactions

Fetch bank transactions using the Nordigen API.
Convert raw bank transaction data into app format.
Auto-Categorization

Use transaction descriptions to match spending categories automatically.

4. Multi-Device Syncing (Firebase Firestore)
How it Works:
Transactions are stored in Firebase Firestore, so users can access them across multiple devices.
Implementation Steps:
Set Up Firestore Database

Use Firebase Authentication.
Store transactions under each user’s unique ID in Firestore.
Sync Data in Real Time

Listen for changes in the database so the UI updates when new transactions are added.

5. Reports & Insights (Charts & Graphs)
How it Works:
Users see visual summaries of their spending habits.
Implementation Steps:
Use Chart Libraries

Use react-native-chart-kit or VictoryCharts to display graphs.
Generate Insights

Pie chart for category breakdown.
Line chart for spending trends over time.
Bar chart for income vs. expenses.

6. Recurring Transactions & Bills
How it Works:
Users can set up recurring expenses like rent, subscriptions, and loans.
Implementation Steps:
Store Recurring Transactions in Firestore

Use a flag (isRecurring: true) and store the next due date.
Automate Transactions

Use a background task (react-native-background-fetch) to add recurring transactions on their due date.
7. User Authentication 
Users can sign in with Google or email/password using Firebase Authentication.

8. Privacy & Security
How it Works:
Data should be encrypted and protected.
Implementation Steps:
Secure User Data

Use Firestore rules to restrict access (userId === auth.uid).
Encrypt sensitive data with expo-secure-store.
Biometric Login

Use react-native-fingerprint-scanner for Face ID/Touch ID login.

9. Offline Mode (SQLite or AsyncStorage)
How it Works:
Users should be able to add transactions offline, which sync when they reconnect.
Implementation Steps:
Store Transactions Locally

Use SQLite (react-native-sqlite-storage) or AsyncStorage for temporary storage.
Sync with Firebase When Online

When the user reconnects, upload offline transactions to Firestore.

10. Multi-Currency Support
How it Works:
Users can track expenses in different currencies, with automatic conversion.
Implementation Steps:
Allow Users to Select a Currency

Add a setting to choose a primary currency.
Convert Transactions Automatically

Use an API like Open Exchange Rates or CurrencyLayer to fetch real-time exchange rates.
Show Multi-Currency Reports

Convert all transactions to the user’s primary currency for summary reports.



10. Receipt Scanning (OCR & AI Categorization)
How it Works:
Users take a photo of a receipt.
The app extracts text (OCR) from the receipt.
Extracted text is analyzed to find key details (merchant name, total amount, date, and itemized purchases).
AI categorizes the transaction based on patterns.
The user reviews and confirms the transaction before adding it to their budget.
Implementation Steps:
Use a Library for OCR

Use Google's ML Kit (react-native-camera + mlkit-ocr) or Tesseract.js to extract text from images.
Example package: react-native-text-recognition.
Extract Key Information from Text

Write a function to scan the text and identify keywords such as:
Merchant name (find the first line that doesn’t contain numbers).
Date (look for patterns like MM/DD/YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD).
Total price (typically follows “Total: $xx.xx”).
Use AI for Categorization

Use a basic machine learning model (TensorFlow.js) or OpenAI’s GPT API to match receipt items to spending categories (e.g., "Groceries", "Entertainment").
Alternatively, use rule-based keyword mapping (e.g., if receipt mentions "Walmart", classify as "Groceries").
User Confirmation

Show a preview of the extracted details and allow the user to edit them before saving.



Priorities:
- Front Page (Base Page)

📌 Page Overview
The base page serves as the dashboard where users get an at-a-glance summary of their financial status. It should feature:
✅ Balance Overview – Displays total balance and net savings.
✅ Recent Transactions – Shows the latest spending and income.
✅ Budget Status – Visual breakdown of expenses by category.
✅ Quick Actions – Buttons for adding transactions, scanning receipts, or syncing with a bank.
✅ Navigation Bar – Allows seamless switching between different sections (Dashboard, Transactions, Reports, Settings).

🏷️ Category (e.g., "Groceries")
⏳ Date & Time (e.g., "Feb 24, 3:45 PM")
📌 Design Style:

Transactions are displayed in card format with soft shadows.
Each transaction uses an icon (e.g., 🛒 for groceries, 🍽️ for restaurants, 🚗 for transport).
Uses a swipe-to-delete gesture for easy transaction removal.
4️⃣ Budget & Spending Insights (Graphs & Charts)
Pie Chart: 🔵 Monthly Expenses Breakdown (e.g., 40% Rent, 20% Food, 15% Subscriptions, etc.)
